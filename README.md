React Exercises
===============

Welcome to the **React Exercises** repository! This repository contains a series of exercises designed to help you practice and improve your React development skills. Each exercise is structured as an independent project, allowing you to focus on a specific concept without dependencies on other exercises.

Introduction
------------

This repository consists of individual React exercises, with each exercise set up as a separate project. You can work on the exercises independently, without needing to worry about any interdependencies.

Each exercise includes its own `package.json`, meaning you will need to install dependencies and run the project individually for each exercise.

Getting Started
---------------

### Prerequisites

Before starting, make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

-   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 14 or higher)
-   [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)

### Running an Exercise

1.  Clone this repository:

     ```bash

    git clone https://github.com/latifii/react-exercises.git
    cd react-exercises

1.  Navigate to the folder of the exercise you'd like to work on:

    ```bash

    cd Exercise1

2.  Install the dependencies for that specific exercise:

    ```bash

    npm install

3.  Start the development server for that exercise:

    ```bash

    npm start

This will start the React app for the chosen exercise. Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in your browser.

### Notes:

-   You will need to repeat the above steps for each individual exercise.
-   Each exercise runs independently, so changes in one exercise won't affect others.
